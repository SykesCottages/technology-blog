## Background ##

Like most businesses we have been faced with challenges with getting more people working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It's fair to say that MS teams has been a huge benefit to the business. It has enabled users communicating while all working from home. With the start of restrictions lifting in the UK we now face challenges of how we start to get the teams back into the office and how communication will work as part of a new hybrid way of working with reduced numbers in the office and a move to more people working from home.

As a result we have started to look at setting up Poly x30 devices in meeting rooms. The idea to enable each meeting room to be used for teams calls with multiple users.

## Requirements ##

One of the main requirements that we had while looking for a system was it had to be simple to use. We also did not want something that would be hard to setup and require complicated wiring in the office.

We settled on the Poly X30/X50 range of devices mainly because it was an all in one system. The additional TC8 tablet makes the device very easy to use without a lot of training and as cabling was very minimal we did not run the risk of users unplugging devices or cables.

We also wanted a device that was designed to work around MS Teams. As a company that is what we rolled out and we knew our users would want to be able to use it.
