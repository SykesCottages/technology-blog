Since Sykes have migrated to using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) we have been more easily able to compare website and app events.
This data from Dec 25th 2021 to January 23rd 2022 highlights the importance and power of mobile apps as a channel.
During this period, the website had over 16 million views, while the apps had just 642,000 (around 4%), although the booking share for app was approximately 7.5%.

While mobile app booking share may only be around 7.5% (and growing), we see some significant differences in the number of key events per user:

 
|                  |App events per user|Web events per user|
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|Sessions per month|10                 |2                  |
|Searches per month|17                 |6                  |
|Property views per month| 33           |6                  |
|Properties added to favourites per month|7 | 3             |
|Average Engagement Time| 16 minutes    |       6 minutes   |

Aligning our analytics across platforms has enabled us to get a broader picture of our customers’ journeys.  
We are continuing to improve and standardise our analytics to gain more insight into multi-channel behaviour to help us understand and support our customers.
User research and behavioural data gathered from Google Analytics and other sources drives our decision making and are integral to our success at Sykes.
