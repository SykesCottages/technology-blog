# Owners are earning over 24% more per booking on average versus 2020 for January departures

A key feature of our technology platform here at Sykes is how our systems can quickly respond to changes in customer demand. Last week we showed how we’re seeing a surge in demand for short lead breaks. This time we’ve pulled together a quick viz to show the impact that surge in demand has had on average income for our owners

This simple viz is showing the year on year % difference in average owner income per booking for holidays in January. As you can see there was healthy growth in 2020 versus 2019 but this has been dwarfed by the increases our owners have enjoyed in 2022.
Further evidence of the advantages of being on board with Sykes and our award-winning technology platform. Our tools and team work together ensuring we balance booking volume and revenue growth. We have come a very long way from 52-week brochure pricing.
