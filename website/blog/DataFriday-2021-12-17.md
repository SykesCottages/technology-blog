In this post we are having a look at what people are booking right now. For bookings made since the start of the month we are looking at how they break down in terms of region and season.

In terms of season we can see most people are booking short lead time (the remaining few months of this year and the Winter months of 2022) these two bubbles combined account for nearly 54% of our bookings.

Regionally, The lakes, North Wales and Cornwall are our most popular destinations right now.

In our next post we will dive into this a little further and look into how this compares to previous years
